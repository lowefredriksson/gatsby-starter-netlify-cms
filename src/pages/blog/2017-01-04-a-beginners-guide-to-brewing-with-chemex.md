Louis Weisdorf (born in 1932) is a well-known Danish architect and designer. After graduating from the The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen in 1954, Weisdorf worked with everything from graphic-, interior- and industrial design, to recreational areas as well as most fields within the building trade. He described his career as "specialises in versatility", which, quite perfectly, sums up the long and notable career of this multi-designer.

In 1961, he started a ten-year assignment at Tivoli, amusement park in Copenhagen, and worked as the main assistant to Tivoliâ€™s chief architect Simon P Henningsen. In the late 1960's, Weisdorf set up his own design studio in Copenhagen, sharing the premises with architect Ole Panton (the younger brother of Verner Panton), where he served both national and international clients. During his active time as a designer, Weisdorf worked closely with many designers including Verner Panton, Poul Henningsen and Le Klint.

Louis Weisdorf has always been interested in creating lights from a single element that could be repeated and built together in various fashions and a guiding principle of shielding the eye from direct bulb glare at all angles, which can for example be seen in his Turbo Pendant from 1967.

Today, Weisdorf lamps are collectors' items and can be bought on auctions.
